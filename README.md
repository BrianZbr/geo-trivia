# Geo-Trivia
Geo-Trivia is a simple quiz game written in Python. It was developed as a final project for the Nucamp Fundamentals of Python course and inspired by the [country-json](https://github.com/samayo/country-json/) repository. It uses that dataset to automatically generate multiple choice questions about world capitals, languages and cuisines. It will also track high scores for multiple players.

## How to run
A live version of this project is available to play on Replit. 

To run locally, clone or download this repository, then clone or download country-json into the same folder.

For example:
```bash
